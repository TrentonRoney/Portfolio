                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Trenton Roney, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of Missouri. I initially started as a business major and secured an internship at Veterans United Home Loans in the "Business Opportunities" section. During the summer between my freshman and sophomore years, I transitioned to Computer Science while continuing my internship. I have been working at Veterans United as an intern for the past 3 years.</p>

                <h2>Collegiate Career</h2>
                <p>Starting as a freshman, I was initially a business major and secured a "Business Opportunities" internship at Veterans United Home Loans. During the summer between my freshman and sophomore years, I switched my major to Computer Science but continued with my internship. I am still working at Veterans United as an intern and have been there for 3 years. Balancing work and school has been challenging but rewarding. I am currently pursuing my Computer Science degree and am looking for internship opportunities related to my field.</p>
