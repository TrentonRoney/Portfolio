## Bachelor of Computer Science @ University of Missouri
**Classes taken, along with descriptions provided by Mizzou (FALL 2022 - Present):**

- **CS1050 - Algorithm Design & Programming I**: Provides experience in developing algorithms and designing and implementing programs using the C programming language. Topics include syntax/semantics, flow control, loops, recursion, I/O, arrays, strings, and pointers.
  
- **CS2050 - Algorithm Design & Programming II**: Study of fundamental techniques and algorithms for representing and manipulating data structures. Topics include data abstraction, recursion, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, efficient methods of sorting and searching, and Big-O analysis.
  
- **CS3050 - Advanced Algorithm Design**: Surveys fundamental algorithms and data structures with wide practical applicability, including search trees and graph algorithms. Emphasis on techniques for efficient implementation and good software development methodologies.
  
- **CS3330 - Object-Oriented Programming**: Focuses on object-oriented programming concepts such as abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes, files, streams, and object serialization. Includes GUI and event-driven programming, APIs, and design patterns.
  
- **CS3380 - Database Applications and Information Systems**: Covers foundational concepts in database systems, including database modeling with Entity-Relationship diagrams, implementation of relational data models using SQL, optimization through functional dependencies, introduction to B+-trees for physical indexing, and culminates in the design and implementation of a semester-long database project.
  
- **CS3530 - UNIX Operating System**: Introduction to the UNIX operating system and operating systems based on UNIX design. Includes interfaces such as filesystem, command shells, text editors, input/output systems, shell scripting, cloud computing, and system administration.
  
- **Associates in Business Finance**: Completed an Associate degree in Business Finance at Moberly Area Community College. Duration: Fall 2021 - Spring 2022.
